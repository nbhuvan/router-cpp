>Implemented both LS and DV routing algorithms using C++ and object-oriented programming. 

>The files Router.h and Router.cpp contains a general class of router which can be used to initiate any number of routers.

>This class also includes the neccessary functions which an actual router has. By using this class we get an object very close to that of the an actual router.

>It has both LS and DS routing algorithms implemented in itself. We used different initialization for different algorithms. 

>For LS we have the information about all other routers too, but in DS routing algorithm we have only that of connected routers.

>Used a queue to act as the common memory where all the routers dump their sent packets.

>Implemeted Routing Table and Minimum Distance from the present node to all the other nodes.
